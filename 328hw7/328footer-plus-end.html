<!-- our html-template.html required footer with validation link,
         now in a separate file for more-convenient require_once
         inclusion in CS 328 web pages!

         THIS version also includes ending body and html tags,
         for when an error condition is causing one to EXIT one's
         PHP prematurely...! (and so you want to end the body and
         html elements HERE and NOW)
