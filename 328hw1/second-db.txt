Homework 1 Problem 2

01/25/23

I have decided to use a database that will be provided to the class rather than using 
the database that me and my partner Jake Freed made last semester.

Furthermore me and my partner agreed to not put our copies of our database model to share
with the class. We will like to keep our work to ourselves for now.
