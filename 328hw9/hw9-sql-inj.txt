Homework 9 Problem 2


1) From the article "SQL Injection Attacks by Example" it states that the error response can be a 
    dead give-away to a user-input not being sanitized properly which ends up making the application 
    open to exploitation. I chose this because I never realized how a specific error can be a giveaway 
    to a poorly constructed webpage.

2) From the article "How security flaws work: SQL injection" it talks about how bad both being able to 
    read and write sensitive data to a database can cause such problems. Especially that since they can create 
    a username and login with that password they know , they will automatically gain access to the database information.
    I chose this beacuse it is important to always make sure everything is secured and to make sure sensitive information 
    never should fall in the wrong hands especially since they can gain so much power over it.

3) From the article "How security flaws work: SQL injection" it brings up the fact that using db_name() SQL Server function 
   it will returns the name of the current database by simply outputting an error and plaintly outputting the database name
   something an attacker can easily take advantage of. I chose this because it shows how easily an attacker can gain access 
   to important information of a database and the creators must be aware of these harmful techniques attackers use.
