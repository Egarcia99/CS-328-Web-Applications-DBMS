<h1> This Is The Rap about Code </h1>

<h2> Emilyo Garcia and Victor Diaz </h2>

<p> Give Us Those Clicker Questions!</p>

<blockquote><p> Yo, let me tell you 'bout code
It's the language that powers the globe
It's like building with dgital bricks,
Creating magic with a few qlicks.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Code, code, its the way to go
With HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in tow
Code, code, it's your time to shine,
Take your skills to the next level, that's fine.
