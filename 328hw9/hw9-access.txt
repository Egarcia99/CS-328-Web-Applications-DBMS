Homework 9 Problem 1

        "Designing for accessibility is not that hard"

1) One thing I would like to remember from the website is that using labels or instructions
    for form fields and inputs will guide users to a smooth process while using your website.

2) Another thing I would like to keep in the back of my mind is the key importance of keyboard 
    accessibility. As many people navigating rely on screen readers, they will be dependent on a 
    keyboard to navigate through content within your website.

3) The last thing I would like to remember is something I tend to forget. Remembering to write useful 
    alternative content for your images and other non-text content is as important as the image that is 
    inserted into the website.


        "Teach Access Initiative's short tutorial"

1) Having a checklist for improving my visual designs in a website seems like something that can 
    really help me improve how my design for my website looks and adjusting everything to optimze 
    the visual aspect is key to any website

2) Text Size in a website is also a very crucial aspect in order for your website to look as professional
    and apporiate for everyone that uses it

3) Color contrast is key for any text to appear clear within the webpage and will standout as wanted since
  there can be a lot of text and important information can hide if not apportatley contrasted in the website.
