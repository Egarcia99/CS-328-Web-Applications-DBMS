# CS328 Web Applications with Databases - Spring 2023

Welcome to my GitHub repository for CS328: Web Applications with Databases, taught in the Spring 2023 semester at California Polytechnic University of Humboldt. This repository is a comprehensive showcase of my technical abilities, hands-on experience, and the tangible outcomes of my coursework. It includes databases, websites, web applications, homework, and lab exercises developed throughout the course, demonstrating my proficiency in full-stack web development with a focus on database integration.

## Course Highlights

Throughout the semester, we covered a wide range of topics that span across different tiers of web application development, with a strong emphasis on the seamless integration between client-side technologies, server-side scripting, and database management systems. Here's a brief overview of the topics we explored:

- Week 1: Introduction to the course, n-tiered architectures, and PL/SQL.
- Week 2: PL/SQL stored procedures, stored functions, and exception-handling.
- Week 3: Introduction to HTML5.
- Week 4: Continued introduction to HTML5 and starting CSS3.
- Week 5: Continued introduction to CSS3.
- Week 6: Discussion on web design and designing for accessibility.
- Week 7: Introduction to PHP.
- Week 8: Continued PHP; Security concepts including XSS and SQL injection.
- SPRING BREAK
- Week 9: Continued PHP; Finite State Machines (FSMs), statelessness of HTTP, and PHP sessions.
- Week 10: Introduction to client-side JavaScript.
- Week 11: Continued client-side JavaScript.
- Week 12: Client-side JavaScript libraries; Introduction to jQuery.
- Week 13: Introduction to XML and JSON.
- Week 14: Discussion on AJAX.
- Week 15: Review for Final Exam and final project presentations.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains a curated selection of databases, websites, web applications, along with the homework and lab exercises I completed during the course. Each project and assignment is accompanied by detailed documentation and reflection on the technologies used and the challenges overcome. Key contents include:

- Databases: SQL scripts, database schemas, and PL/SQL procedures showcasing back-end logic and data storage solutions.
- Websites/Web Applications: Source code for front-end and back-end development, including HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript files. Each project emphasizes user experience, accessibility, and security.
- Homework and Labs: Completed assignments that illustrate my application of course concepts in practical scenarios, including client-server communication, session management, and AJAX implementations.
- Final Project: A comprehensive web application project that integrates all the skills learned throughout the course, demonstrating my ability to design, develop, and deploy a full-stack web application.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to exhibit the breadth and depth of my knowledge and skills in creating web applications that effectively interact with databases. It serves as a testament to my ability to tackle complex web development projects and deliver robust, secure, and user-friendly applications.

Thank you for visiting my CS328 coursework repository. I hope these projects and exercises provide insight into my technical competencies and my approach to solving real-world problems with innovative web solutions.
